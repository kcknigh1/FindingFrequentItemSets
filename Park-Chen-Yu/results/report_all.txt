I used a hash table of size 4000 because it made Phase1 use about the same
memory as the largest loop of the second phase using the A-Priori method.
It apears that the Phase2 of PCY uses as much memory as A-Prori so the adding the bit vector
did not help. It also made the PCY take more time to do the computations.
