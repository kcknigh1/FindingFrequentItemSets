This project compares the time and memory required to find frequent item sets with a varying S value. It has results for both the A-Priori and Park-Chen-Yu algorithms.  The results of the test are stored in the results dir

More details on each of the implimentations and how to run the programs are in there individule READMEs

Example Report:

This is a collection of all the values.
More details can be found in there individual result files.
There were to many valus to show legibly in one file
